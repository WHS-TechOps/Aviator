Aviator - Web Browser

Quote from [Aviator Going Open Source](https://blog.whitehatsec.com/aviator-going-open-source/) blog post

> So we hope that people use the browser and make it their own. We won’t be making any additional changes to the browser; Aviator is now entirely community-driven. We’ll still sign the releases, QA them and push them to production, but the code itself will be community-driven. If the community likes Aviator, it will thrive, and now that we have a critical mass of technical users and people who love it, it should be possible for it to survive on its own without much input from WhiteHat.
